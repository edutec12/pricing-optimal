Demand-Response (Sequential Least Squares Programming)
This code uses numerical optimization and visualization libraries in Python to implement a Nash equilibrium algorithm for a pricing game between users and an electric service provider. The code defines the objective functions for both parties, constraints, bounds for variables, and optimization functions to find the optimal prices and demand for each agent given the other's prices and demand. The Nash equilibrium algorithm iteratively updates the prices and demand until convergence is reached. Finally, the code calculates the social welfare and optimal prices and demand for both agents and visualizes the results using Matplotlib.
